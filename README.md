# Population and income analysis by country

## Basic overview

This project involves the exploratory data analysis of the change in population, life expectancy and income of countries all across the world by year. The dataset used for the project contains the required data for each of these countries by region and year. The data set goes back all the way to 1800 to the most recent year which is 2015. 

## Purpose

This project is part of the coursework of the analytics ANLY 506 O or Exploratory Data Analysis course at Harrisburg University. Over the course of the project, several principles learnt as part of the course will be applied to the data to understand the data. This includes descriptive summary and exploratory plots of the data, understanding the data varaibility and visualization of the data as required.

As an initial premise, the project will attempt to establish the region and countries that have demonstrated the highest increase in life expectancy and income change over the years. The project will also involve the use of clustering techniques to group countries based on their development over the years. The clustering algorithm will attempt to combine countries based on developed, developing and under developed countries. Over the course of the exploratory data analysis, the project will also attempt to identify other questions about the data.

## Methodology

THe analysis methodology used is the epicycle of analysis. This involves five core activities:

1. Stating the question
2. Exploratory data analysis
3. Model building
4. Interpret
5. Communicate

This concept is from the Art of Data Science by Roger Peng and Elizabeth Matsui.

Every step of the process will be completed using 3 steps called the epicycle of analysis:

1. Develop Expectations
2. Collect Data
3. Match Expectations with Data

The project will use this methodology through every step and revise the question and add questions as needed.

The project will adequately report the steps followed in the project and the findings of the project.

## Data source description

The name of the dataset given to us is gapminder.csv. The dataset contains six fields: Country, year, population, Income, Region. The source of the data is from github user 'Sarah Bird'. The link of the datasource is given below:

https://raw.githubusercontent.com/birdsarah/pydata-nc/master/tutorial/assets/gapminder.csv

The dataset contains a total of 41824 records with 6 variables. Quickly combing through the data we notice there are several missing observations which we will have to account for. There is data about a total of 197 countries ranging from 1800 to 2015. The  197 countries are from a total of 6 regions. It is also noted that population is not a numeric variable whereas life expectancy and income are numeric variables.
